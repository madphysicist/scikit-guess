Concept
=======

The concept behind this paper is that integrals and derivatives can be
estimated through differentials and cumulative sums. The goal is to set up an
integral or differential equation whose solution is the model function. If the
right-hand side of such an equation can be expressed as a linear combination of
integrals and derivatives of itself multiplied by some other pre-determined
functions, we can estimate the numerical values of the equation's terms. While
the coefficients that make the equation work depend on the fitting parameters,
the functions themselves do not. It is therefore possible to set up a simple
linear regression for the coefficients based on the numerical approximations of
the integrals and derivatives. The numerical approximation of integrals by
cumulative sums tend to be more robust than the approximations of derivatives
by differentials, so integral equations are generally preferred.

Circle Fitting by Linear and Nonlinear Least Squares

This paper by Ian Coope demonstrates a way to linearize a non-linear least
squares problem.

Concept
=======

Rather than solving the traditional non-linear least squares problem for
n-dimensional circles, this paper proposes a change of variable that reduces
the problem to a simple linear least squares. The change appears to yield more
robust results in some cases. This is one of the multidimensional optimizations
offered in the scikit.
