scikit-guess
============

This scikit contains methods for computing fast, non-iterative estimates of
fitting parameters for common functions. The estimates may be used as-is on
their own, or refined through non-linear optimization algorithms. The name of
the scikit comes from the fact that estimates are a good initial guess for the
optimal fitting parameters.
