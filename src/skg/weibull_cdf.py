r"""
Weibull cumulative distribution fit with three parameters, of the form
:math:`F(t) = 1 - e^{-\left( \frac{t - \mu}{\beta} \right)^{\alpha}}`.

The data :math:`F_k` must be positive. Unlike the other estimations,
which are sorted according to their independent variable, this one
expects the dependent variable to be sorted in ascending order.


.. todo::

   Add proper handling of colinear inputs (and other singular matrix cases).

.. todo::

   Add tests.

.. todo::

   Add nan_policy argument.

.. todo::

   Add PEP8 check to formal tests.

.. todo::

   Add axis parameter.

    r"""
    Weibull CDF fit of the form
    :math:`F(t) = 1 - e^{-\left( \frac{t - \mu}{\beta} \right)^{\alpha}}`.

    This implementation is based on a transformation that makes the
    approximate solution to integral equation :eq:`exp-eq`, presented in
    :ref:`ref-reei` applicable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        The x-values of the data points, :math:`t` in the equation. The
        fit will be performed on a raveled version of this array.
    y : array-like
        The y-values of the data points corresponding to `x`,
        :math:`F(t)` in the equation. Must be the same size as `x`. The
        fit will be performed on a raveled version of this array.
    sorted : bool
        Set to True if `y` is already monotonically increasing or
        decreasing. If False, `y` will be sorted into increasing order,
        and `x` will be sorted along with it.

    Return
    ------
    alpha, beta, mu : ~numpy.ndarray
        A 3-element array of optimized fitting parameters. The first
        parameter is the shape, the second the scale, and the third the
        mean of the PDF.

    Notes
    -----
    The x- and y- data is conventionally transposed from what the final
    optimization expects. `y` is expected to be ascending or descending,
    not `x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        The value of the model will be the same shape as the input.
    alpha : float
        The shape of the distribution.
    beta : float
        The scale of the distribution.
    mu : float
        The mean of the distribution.
